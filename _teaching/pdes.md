Topics include:

- the Taylor series
- big-O notational
- finite-difference approximations
- elliptic PDEs (the Laplace and Poisson equations)
- hyperbolic PDEs (the advection equation)
- time marching schemes
- parabolic PDEs (the heat diffusion equation)
- grid refinement studies
- solving systems of PDEs (the shallow water equations)
