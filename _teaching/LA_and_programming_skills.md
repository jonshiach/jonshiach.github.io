A first year unit that introduces students to linear algebra, Python and MATLAB programming.

- [Linear algebra lecture notes](https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book){:target="_blank"}
- [Programming skills materials](https://github.com/jonshiach/Programming_skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"){:target="_blank"}

<!--more-->

Topics include: 
- matrices
- vectors
- solving linear systems of equations
- co-ordinate geometry
- vector spaces
- linear transformations.


The programming skills materials take the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python and [MATLAB live scripts](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/live-scripts-and-functions.html) for MATLAB. This allows students to enter and execute code in the same document as the instructional material.
