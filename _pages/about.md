I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing and mathematics at the [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/). During my career I have taught on a number of different degree programmes and have supervised post-graduate research students. In addition to teaching, I have taken roles including Programme Leader for BSc (Hons) Mathematics course, department student experience lead and final year level tutor.

My research was in computational fluid dynamics, in particular using finite-volume methods for solving depth-integrated equations. I was awarded my PhD in Mathematics in 2008 by the Manchester Metropolitan University for my [thesis](/files/papers/shiach_thesis.pdf) titled "Numerical modelling of wave run-up and overtopping using depth integrated equations".

In my spare time I enjoy cycling and am a keen supporter of [Gloucester Rugby](https://www.gloucesterrugby.co.uk/). I have four cats and have been attempting to learn how to play the guitar for about twenty years.
