I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Computing and mathematics at the [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/). During my career I have taught on a number of different degree programmes and have supervised post-graduate research students. In addition to teaching, I have taken roles including Programme Leader for BSc (Hons) Mathematics course, department student experience lead and final year level tutor.

In my spare time I enjoy cycling and am a keen supporter of [Gloucester Rugby](https://www.gloucesterrugby.co.uk/). I have four cats and am attempting to learn how to play the guitar.
