# Welcome!

Welcome to my homepage. I am a senior lecturer in the [Department of Computing and Mathematics](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/computing-and-maths/) at the [Manchester Metropolitan University]([www.mmu.ac.uk](https://www.mmu.ac.uk/)) in the UK. My teaching interests mainly include numerical methods, programming and linear algebra but I also teach computer graphics and supervise undergraduate mathematics and data analytics projects.

This site is used to host the materials that support my [teaching](/teaching.md) and [outreach](/outreach.md) activities as well as other miscellaneous projects and coding examples.
