During my career I have taught a number of different units across several degree programmes. I currently teach units on linear algebra, programming, computer graphics, numerical methods for ODEs and graduate development and employability.

## Linear Algebra

A first year unit that introduces students to linear algebra.

## Programming Skills

A first year unit that introduces students to programming in Python and MATLAB. The programming skills materials take the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python and [MATLAB live scripts](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/live-scripts-and-functions.html) for MATLAB. This allows students to enter and execute code in the same document as the instructional material. For instructions on how to download and install Jupyter click [here](/jupyter-notebook){:target="_blank"}.

### Python materials

1. [Python basics](/files/Python_materials/1_python_basics.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
2. [Arrays](/files/Python_materials/2_arrays.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
3. [If statements](/files/Python_materials/3_if_statements.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
4. [Loops](/files/Python_materials/4_loops.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
5. [Functions](/files/Python_materials/5_functions.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
6. [Plotting](/files/Python_materials/6_plotting.ipynb){:target="_blank"} (you will also need to download the files <a href="/files/Python_materials/flower.jpg" download target="_blank">flower.jpg</a> and  <a href="/files/Python_materials/new_JD_building.jpg" download target="_blank">new_JD_building.jpg</a>.
7. [Symbolic mathematics](/files/Python_materials/7_symbolic_mathematics.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

### MATLAB materials



## Graduate Development and Employability

A first year unit that develops students' employability skills and explores how to study mathematics at undergraduate level.


## Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations

A third year content that covers numerical methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and linear systems of equations.

- <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/ODEs-book/" target="_blank">Runge-Kutta Methods and Linear Algebra Lecture notes</a>

## Computational Mathematics

A second year unit that examines the implementation of mathematics in modern computing applications such as computer graphics used in computer games, digital sound processing and computing mathematics.

- [Computer Graphics Lecture notes](/files/notes/graphics_notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- [Digital Sound Processing Lecture Notes](/files/notes/sound_processing_notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- [Computing Mathematics Lecture Notes](/files/notes/computing_maths_notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

A third year unit that covers the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

- [Finite-Difference Methods Lecture Notes](/files/notes/finite_difference_methods_notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Mathematics of Computer Graphics and Virtual Environments

A second year unit (discontinued) that explores the mathematics that underpins computer graphics used in computer games and the TV and film industry.
