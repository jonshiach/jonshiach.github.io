I teach across a number of units and courses at the Manchester Metropolitan University. I currently teach units on linear algebra, programming, computational mathematics, numerical methods for ODEs and graduate development and employability. My teaching materials can be accessed below.

## Linear Algebra and Programming Skills

</p> -->

A first year unit that introduces students to linear algebra, [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) programming.

### Linear algebra

<a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/" target="_blank">Linear algebra lecture notes</a>

Topics include: matrices, vectors, solving linear systems of equations, co-ordinate geometry, vector spaces and linear transformations.

### Programming skills

<a href="https://github.com/jonshiach/Programming_skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">Download programming skills materials</a>

The programming skills materials take the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python and [MATLAB live scripts](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/live-scripts-and-functions.html) for MATLAB. This allows students to enter and execute code in the same document as the instructional material.
