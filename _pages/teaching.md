During my career I have taught a number of different units across several degree programmes. I currently teach units on linear algebra, programming, computer graphics, numerical methods for ODEs and graduate development and employability.

## Linear Algebra

A first year unit that introduces students to linear algebra. Topics include matrices, vectors, co-ordinate geometry, systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations.

## Programming Skills

A first year unit that introduces students to programming in Python and MATLAB. The programming skills materials take the form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python and [MATLAB live scripts](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/live-scripts-and-functions.html) for MATLAB. This allows students to enter and execute code in the same document as the instructional material. For instructions on how to download and install Jupyter click [here](/jupyter-notebook){:target="_blank"}.

## Graduate Development and Employability

A first year unit that develops students' employability skills and explores how to study mathematics at undergraduate level.

## Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations

A third year content that covers numerical methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and linear systems of equations. Topics include initial value problems, the Euler method, explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta methods, stability, boundary values problems, solutions to systems of linear equations using direct and indirect methods.

## Computational Mathematics

A second year unit that examines the implementation of mathematics in modern computing applications such as computer graphics used in computer games, digital sound processing and computing mathematics.

## Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

A third year unit that covers the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

- [Finite-Difference Methods Lecture Notes](/files/notes/finite_difference_methods_notes.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Mathematics of Computer Graphics and Virtual Environments

A second year unit (discontinued) that explores the mathematics that underpins computer graphics used in computer games and the TV and film industry.
