There are a number of ways in which to install Python on your computer. 

## Using Anaconda

Perhaps the easiest is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which is a suite of programs that includes Python and Jupyter notebook.

1. Go to [www.anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) and click on the download link. This should download the installer correct for your operating system.
2. Install Anaconda onto your computer. In most instances the default installation options will suffice. Note that you may need administration privileges to install Anaconda.
