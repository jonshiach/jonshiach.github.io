I often refer students to the excellent YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) by Grant Sanderson who produces videos that explain various mathematical concepts. To produce these videos Grant wrote the Python library [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) and released it for anyone to be able to use. The learning curve is a little steep at first but with the help of the documentation written by the [manim community](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html) it soon becomes straightforward to create your own videos.

This video here was my first attempt. After generating the video file with manim I used the [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/uk/imovie/) application on a Mac to edit the various scenes together, record the voice over and add the background music. I have only dabbled with manim and plan to produce more videos when time allows.
