To produce these videos Grant wrote the Python library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/3b1b/manim&quot;&gt;manim&lt;/a&gt; and released it for anyone to be able to use. The learning curve is a little steep at first but with the help of the documentation written by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html&quot;&gt;manim community&lt;/a&gt; it soon becomes straightforward to create your own videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video here was my first attempt. After generating the video file with manim I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/uk/imovie/&quot;&gt;iMovie&lt;/a&gt; application on a Mac to edit the various scenes together, record the voice over and add the background music. I have only dabbled with manim and plan to produce more videos when time allows.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr Jon Shiach</name><email>j.shiach@mmu.ac.uk</email></author><category term="video" /><category term="manim" /><category term="python" /><summary type="html">I often refer students to the excellent YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown by Grant Sanderson who produces videos that explain various mathematical concepts.
