Python is becomming more popular in the workplace as well as academia so it is a good idea to learn it to enhance your skillset. This is the first in a series of Jupyter notebooks which will introduce you to Python and by working through the interactive examples and exercises you will develop your programming skills."

The easiest way to install Python onto your own machine is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which is a suite of scientific programming tools which is available for most operating systems and is free to download and use. Acaconda includes two programs which we can use to write Python programs: **Jupyter Notebook** and **Spyder**. These materials use Jupyter notebooks to teach Python but Spyder is also useful for writing longer programs.\n",
