Mathematicians refer to this property as **self similarity** and can be seen in nature, some examples of which are shown below.\n",

There are even small Mandelbrot sets found which we can also zoom into so the Mandelbrot set has the self-similarity property found in other fractals. The code in the code cell below plots the region of the Mandelbrot set defined by bottom-left and top-right co-ordinates (-1.05, 0.25) and (-0.95, 0.35) and calculated for 200 iterations. Explore the Mandelbrot set by changing these values (increase `maxIterations` to get more detail)."
